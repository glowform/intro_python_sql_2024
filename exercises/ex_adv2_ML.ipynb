    "### Data simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a simulated dataset representing a business scenerio. For example, simulate a dataset with features such as customer_id, age, income, purchase_history, and customer_satisfaction.\n",
    "- Use numpy or pandas to generate this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform EDA using pandas and visualizations (e.g., using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to understand the data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.\n",
    "- Identify potential features for modeling and any data preprocessing required (e.g., scaling, handling missing values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data manipulation with SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store the simulated data. Consider using NoSQL databases.\n",
    "- Use SQL queries to aggregate or filter the data, such as finding average customer satisfaction by age group or income bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model development and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model selection and implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression for predicting customer satisfaction based on features.\n",
    "- Decision Trees for classification based on customer segments.\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting for improved predictions.\n",
    "- Neural Networks as an alternative approach.\n",
    "- Use libraries like Scikit-learn and Keras to implement these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model training\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training, validation and testing sets.\n",
    "- Train the selected models on the training set and evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or other for regression and accuracy for classification.\n",
    "- Cross-Validation - implement K-Fold cross-validation to assess model stability and performance better\n",
    "- Feature engineering - create new features based on existing ones (e.g., a new feature represnting interaction between age and income).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model evaluation and comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the performance of your models based on evaluation metrics and think about the trade-offs of each model.\n",
    "- Use hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., Grid Search) to optimize model performance. You can try out KerasTuner or look for other libraries.\n",
    "- Sue ensemble methods such as Voting Classifier for classification tasks or Stacking to combine predictions from multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced data visualization and model deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret model predictions, it should help you understand feature importance and model decisions.\n",
    "- Try to save and load models using joblib or pickle, simulating model deployment.\n",
    "- Save your best-performing model and provide a simple interface to make predictions on new simulated customer data.\n"

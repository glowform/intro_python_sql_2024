    "## Setting Up the Project \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up the Django project and the analytics_dashboard app.\n",
    "- Use a virtual environment and organize the project.\n",
    "- Optional: Code it using OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database models and raw SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create models to represent busines data. For example, models for Sales, Customer, and Product. Instead of relying only on Django ORM, integrate raw SQL queries.\n",
    "- Populate the database with some sample data (manually or via CSV import).\n",
    "- Allow file upload for data (CSV or Excel) to populate the models dynamically.\n",
    "- Write custom methods using connection.cursor() to run SQL queries for tasks like getting top-selling products, customer retention rates, or sales by region.\n",
    "- Query sales data to find top 5 customers based on total purchases and display this on the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced SQL queries for business metrics\n",
    " - Write a SQL query to calculate metrics like Average Ordr Value (AOV) or Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and integrate these metrics into the dashboard.\n",
    " - Write SQL queries to filter data by date range, products, or customer types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Views and templates\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create views that use these SQL queries that display summary statistics, such as total sales, average customer spending, or product performance on the frontend.\n",
    "- Build templates with dynamic content based on SQL query results, using charts for visualization (you could use a library like chart.js or plotly).\n",
    "- Allow users to filter results by date range, product category, or customer demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User authentication and permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up user authentication and role-based access control (e.g., admin and standard user).\n",
    "- Only authorized users can access certain parts of the dashboard."

    "## Advanced SQL and Django integration, data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL optimization and query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize SQL queries by adding indexes and testing the impact on performance.\n",
    "- Use the EXPLAIN statement to analyze query efficiency and suggest optimizations (e.g., indexing frequently queried fields like product_id or sales_date).\n",
    "- Create a Django management command to generate a SQL report of daily sales performance and email it to admins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced data handling using SQL and Django ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine ORM with raw SQL to manage complex queries\n",
    "- Use Django ORM for simple queries but fall back on raw SQL for optimized multi-table joins.\n",
    "- Write a custom SQL query for a product sales trend over time (e.g., using GROUP BY and date functions), and integrate this into a visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use SQL queries to feed the data into interactive visualizations (e.g., bar charts for product sales, line graphs for sales over time, pie charts for customer segmentation) using Chart.js, Plotly, or D3.js.\n",
    "- Display sales per month, customer segmentation, and other business metrics calculated through SQL.\n",
    "- Alternatively try using Django REST Framework (DRF) to provide JSON dta to the front-end for these visualizations.\n",
    "- Create an API endpoint (using Django REST Framework) that exposes key business insights (e.g., sales trends, top-performing products).\n",
    "- Add filtering and sorting parameters to the API to allow more flexible queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL security and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think how to securely integrate SQL into Django, avoiding SQL injection by using parameterized queries (cursor.execute(query, params)).\n",
    "- Test the security of SQL queries and improve performance by writing efficient join queries and using indexing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include a feature to dynamically calculate and visualize KPIs such as customer lifetime value (CLV), retention rates, or sales growth.\n",
    "- Implement caching (e.g., using Redis) for expensive data calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write unit tests for the models and views, especially focusing on ensuring the integrity of the analytics results.\n",
    "- Create basic documentation for how to use the dashboard and its features, including API usage.\n",

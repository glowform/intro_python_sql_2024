    "## Introduction to web applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Web applications or websites can be created in multiple ways. Both when it comes to the engine/software (PHP, Python, Ruby etc.) and architecture of the application. In practice, Model View Controller (MVC) or Model View Presenter (MVP, sometimes called a successor to MVC) are the most common architectures. You should know how MVC looks like and create applications according to this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model View Controller:\n",
    "* Model - responsible for data structure. Model represents knowledge/data. A single table or a complex database may be a model.\n",
    "* View - View is the way of displaying a model. View is responsible for presenting data to the user.\n",
    "* Controller - engine which decides what to do with the model (query the model, modify the model, display view with model's data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thorough understanding of the philosophy behind each architecture is mostly unnecessary for beginners. However, you should remember that data storage (model), actions connected with data and reacting to user's input (controller) and way of displaying data (view) are three separate layers which should not be combined. It is not particularly important if you choose MVC or MVP.\n",

    "One of the more common solutions is LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. In Linux operating system, webserver communicates with the net, PHP prepares the content from the MySQL database. In practice solutions/libraries/frameworks make our life easier, so that we do not need to write everything from scratch.\n",

    "In case of Python, Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is usually used. It allows you to combine Python applications with webserver capabilities (communication with web browsers). Fortunately you do not have to understand every part of the webserver when using any Python framework. For a beginner, it \"just works\".\n",

    "## Python frameworks\n",
    "There are many popular Python frameworks. Most commonly used are probably Bottle, Flask, and Django. Bottle, which will be a starting point for you is the smallest and easiest solution, perfectly suited for beginners. Flask is a more advanced alternative, and Django truly is a Swiss knife of web frameworks. Django is used by large websites (Instagram, Washington Post, Pinterest etc.). To sum up, Bottle is a good first step in creating web applications and allows us access to an endless world."

The most distinctive feature of Bottle is that it requires you to write an application in one file. Of course you can use imports, but still it is a limitation which makes Bottle unsuitable for large projects. In a moment you will see how much you can achieve with a simple script.\n",

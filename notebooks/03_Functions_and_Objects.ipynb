    "Currently, most popular programming languages are object-oriented. There are several advantages of objects. First, already mentioned at the beginning of the course, is that you can create elements which possess a state (just like variables), other predefined attributes (multiple variables) and functions. Because you can create multiple objects/instances of the same class simultaneously, object-oriented programming makes situations in which you need multiple instances (e.g. of users) much easier compared with structured programming.\n",

It becomes practical in large projects, because it makes code managing and debugging much easier. You may read more about advantages and disadvantages of object-oriented programming here:\n",

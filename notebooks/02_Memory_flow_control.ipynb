    "## Memory and memory addressing\n",
    "For an analyst Python is an excellent programming language, partly because of its efficiency. Because we are efficiency-oriented, we have to undestand at least the basics of memory management and addressing in programming, especially in Python. Understanding of this issue is important not only for our programs' running time, but first of all - their correctness. This notebook presents slightly simplified and hopefully clear explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective memory management is crucial because of two reasons: **memory is slow**, and in the age of large datasets **memory is valuable**. Because of these reasons we will avoid copying objects and rewriting them in a different place by all means. You may think that RAM is \"fast\", because it is much faster than HDD and even SSD. But it is much slower than contemporary CPUs (this is why CPU cache exists, link below). We will avoid copying, reading and writing because of our programs' efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object which is stored in memory, no matter its size, has its own address. It is true both for small (single int) and large (enormous dataset for analysis) objects. Objects' addresses are always \"small\", even if object itself is very large. This is why it is much easier to pass information about object's address than pass the whole object - create a copy of it in the memory.\n",
